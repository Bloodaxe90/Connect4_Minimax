<h1 align="center">Connect 4 with Minimax</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
After implementing the Minimax algorithm on TicTacToe (https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/TicTacToe-AI-MINIMAX), I decided to implement it on Connect 4, as it has a larger state space. 
</p>
<p>
Like the TicTacToe Minimax project, this one also uses JavaFX, SceneBuilder, and Alpha-Beta Pruning. However, it also includes heuristics, which were added after I discovered long wait times when the AI was picking a move.
</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>
Run the main method in the Connect4Application class
</p>

<h2>Controls:</h2>
<p>
  Its Connect4 (You always play first as blue)
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Left Click Top Buttons:</strong> Places a peice in the corresponding column</li>
    <li><strong>Space Bar or Left Click (on Game Over screen):</strong> Resets the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results:</h2>
