<h1 align="center">Connect 4 with Minimax</h1>

After implementing the Minimax algorithm on TicTacToe (https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/TicTacToe-AI-MINIMAX-), I decided to implement it on Connect 4, as it has a larger state space. Like the TicTacToe Minimax project, this one also uses JavaFX, SceneBuilder, and Alpha-Beta Pruning. However, it also includes heuristics, which were added after I discovered long wait times when the AI was picking a move.
